# Data-driven-healthcare
Git repository for group project

The dataset chosen for the project is from here:
https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/cervical+cancer+risk+factors

Dataset description:
Tabular data on risk factors for cervical cancer (858 patients)

Questions we want to answer:
Can we use these data to predict (classify) cancer?
Can a glassbox model be used to highlight the global features that drive the prediction?
